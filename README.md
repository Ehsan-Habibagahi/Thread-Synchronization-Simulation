# Thread Synchronization Simulation
This project provides a simulation of what `threading.Semaphore` and Mutex in python does. Challenging my self by implementing from scratch. only using `threads.Lock` and `thread.Condition`.
Its functionality is tested in an imaginary banking system.

It's a fun project and hope you like it!🧸
